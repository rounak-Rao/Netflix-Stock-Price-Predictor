# Netflix-Stock-Price-Predictor

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Netflix's stock price based on historical Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data. It explores time series forecasting with deep learning and compares the LSTM modelâ€™s performance against a baseline to demonstrate the value of memory-based models in financial forecasting.

# Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:**
  - `PyTorch` for building and training the LSTM
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` for data preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn` for scaling and metrics
  - `Matplotlib` for visualization
